Differences in the Regulation of Gene Expression of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Organisms
Prokaryotic organisms
Eukaryotic organisms
Lack nucleus
Contain nucleus
RNA transcription and protein
translation occur almost
simultaneously
•
RNA transcription occurs prior to protein translation, and it takes place
in the nucleus. RNA translation to protein occurs in the cytoplasm.
•
RNA post-processing includes addition of a 5' cap, poly-A tail, and
excision of introns and splicing of exons.
Gene expression is regulated
primarily at the transcriptional level
Gene expression is regulated at many levels (epigenetic, transcriptional,
post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational)

Alternative RNA Splicing
In the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a
mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of
introns (and sometimes exons) are removed from the transcript (Figure 9.23). This alternative splicing can be
haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of
different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products
in different cells, or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common
mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70% of genes in humans are expressed as
multiple proteins through alternative splicing.

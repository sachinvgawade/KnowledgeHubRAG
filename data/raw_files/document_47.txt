The National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. The
Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein
signatures specific to different types of cancers. The Biomedical Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein
signatures and design effective therapies for cancer patients.

anneal
in molecular biology, the process by which
two single strands of DNA hydrogen bond at
complementary nucleotides to form a double-
stranded molecule
biomarker
an individual protein that is uniquely
produced in a diseased state
biotechnology
the use of artificial methods to modify
the genetic material of living organisms or cells to
produce novel compounds or to perform new
functions
cloning
the production of an exact copy—specifically,
an exact genetic copy—of a gene, cell, or organism
gel electrophoresis
a technique used to separate
molecules on the basis of their ability to migrate
through a semisolid gel in response to an electric
current
gene therapy
the technique used to cure heritable
diseases by replacing mutant genes with good
genes
genetic engineering
alteration of the genetic makeup
of an organism using the molecular methods of
biotechnology
genetic map
an outline of genes and their location on
a chromosome that is based on recombination
frequencies between markers
genetic testing
identifying gene variants in an
individual that may lead to a genetic disease in that
individual
genetically modified organism (GMO)
an organism
whose genome has been artificially changed
genomics
the study of entire genomes, including the
complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence
and organization, and their interactions within a
species and with other species
metagenomics
the study of the collective genomes of
multiple species that grow and interact in an
environmental niche
model organism
a species that is studied and used as
a model to understand the biological processes in
other species represented by the model organism
pharmacogenomics
the study of drug interactions
with the genome or proteome; also called
toxicogenomics
physical map
a representation of the physical
distance between genes or genetic markers
plasmid
a small circular molecule of DNA found in
bacteria that replicates independently of the main
bacterial chromosome; plasmids code for some
important traits for bacteria and can be used as
vectors to transport DNA into bacteria in genetic
engineering applications
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
a technique used
to make multiple copies of DNA
protein signature
a set of over- or under-expressed
proteins characteristic of cells in a particular
diseased tissue
proteomics
study of the function of proteomes
recombinant DNA
a combination of DNA fragments
generated by molecular cloning that does not exist
in nature
recombinant protein
a protein that is expressed from
recombinant DNA molecules
reproductive cloning
cloning of entire organisms
restriction enzyme
an enzyme that recognizes a
specific nucleotide sequence in DNA and cuts the
DNA double strand at that recognition site, often
with a staggered cut leaving short single strands or
“sticky” ends
reverse genetics
a form of genetic analysis that
manipulates DNA to disrupt or affect the product of
a gene to analyze the gene’s function
transgenic
describing an organism that receives DNA
from a different species
whole genome sequencing
a process that
determines the nucleotide sequence of an entire
genome
Chapter Summary
10.1 Cloning and Genetic Engineering
Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the
purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells
and enzymatically destroying all other major
macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes
can be separated on the basis of size by gel
electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA can be
amplified by PCR. DNA can be cut (and subsequently
re-spliced together) using restriction enzymes. The
molecular and cellular techniques of biotechnology
allow researchers to genetically engineer organisms,
modifying them to achieve desirable traits.
Cloning may involve cloning small DNA fragments
(molecular cloning), or cloning entire organisms
(reproductive cloning). In molecular cloning with
bacteria, a desired DNA fragment is inserted into a
bacterial plasmid using restriction enzymes and the
plasmid is taken up by a bacterium, which will then
express the foreign DNA. Using other techniques,
foreign genes can be inserted into eukaryotic
organisms. In each case, the organisms are called
transgenic organisms. In reproductive cloning, a donor

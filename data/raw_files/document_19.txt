ribosome shifts one codon at a time, catalyzing each process that occurs in the three sites. With each step, a
charged tRNA enters the complex, the polypeptide becomes one amino acid longer, and an uncharged tRNA departs.
The energy for each bond between amino acids is derived from GTP, a molecule similar to ATP (Figure 9.21).
Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a
200-amino acid polypeptide could be translated in just 10 seconds.
FIGURE 9.21 Translation begins when a tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon on the mRNA. The large ribosomal subunit joins the small
subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release
factor into the A site terminates translation and the components dissociate.
Termination of translation occurs when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered. When the ribosome
encounters the stop codon, the growing polypeptide is released and the ribosome subunits dissociate and leave the
mRNA. After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused
in another transcription reaction.

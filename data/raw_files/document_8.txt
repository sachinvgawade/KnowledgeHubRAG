When a cell divides, it is important that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the DNA. This is
accomplished by the process of DNA replication. The replication of DNA occurs during the synthesis phase, or S
phase, of the cell cycle, before the cell enters mitosis or meiosis.
The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA is copied. Recall that adenine
nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides, and cytosine with guanine. This means that the two strands are
complementary to each other. For example, a strand of DNA with a nucleotide sequence of AGTCATGA will have a
complementary strand with the sequence TCAGTACT (Figure 9.8).
FIGURE 9.8 The two strands of DNA are complementary, meaning the sequence of bases in one strand can be used to create the correct
sequence of bases in the other strand.
Because of the complementarity of the two strands, having one strand means that it is possible to recreate the other
strand. This model for replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and
each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied (Figure 9.9).

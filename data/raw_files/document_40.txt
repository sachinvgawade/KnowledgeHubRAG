maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses such as cancer,
heart disease, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. In addition, genome mapping can be used to help identify
organisms with beneficial traits, such as microbes with the ability to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution.
Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to methods that produce higher crop yields or to the
development of plants that adapt better to climate change.

Genetic maps provide the outline, and physical maps provide the details. It is easy to understand why both types of
genome-mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each technique is
used in combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is used with different model organisms that are used
for research. Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more
advances are expected. Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of
available data. Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases,
such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Efforts are made to make the information more
easily accessible to researchers and the general public. Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper
maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI allows us to use a genome viewer tool to simplify the data mining
process.

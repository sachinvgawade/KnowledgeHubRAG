gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 9.22). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled
and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed
(transcriptional level), when RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-
transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been
made (post-translational level).
FIGURE 9.22 Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during transcription and RNA processing, which take place in the nucleus, as well as
during protein translation, which takes place in the cytoplasm. Further regulation may occur through post-translational modifications of
proteins.
The differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in Table
9.2.

FIGURE 9.23 There are five basic modes of alternative splicing. Segments of pre-mRNA with exons shown in blue, red, orange, and pink can
be spliced to produce a variety of new mature mRNA segments.
How could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence, and it is easy to
imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and find the end of the next intron, thus
removing two introns and the intervening exon. In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such exon
skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such “mistakes” would more than likely produce a
nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a
sequence. However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein,
opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an
important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way—by providing genes that may evolve without
eliminating the original functional protein.

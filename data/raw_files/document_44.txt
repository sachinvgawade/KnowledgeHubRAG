FIGURE 10.13 Metagenomics involves isolating DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche. The DNA is cut up and
sequenced, allowing entire genome sequences of multiple species to be reconstructed from the sequences of overlapping pieces.
Creation of New Biofuels
Knowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and
cyanobacteria. The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products such as ethanol.
Although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy
to meet our population’s energy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode
new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. This vast genetic resource
holds the potential to provide new sources of biofuels (Figure 10.14).

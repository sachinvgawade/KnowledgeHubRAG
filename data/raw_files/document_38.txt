FIGURE 10.9 It can be seen that two of these mice are transgenic because they have a gene that causes them to fluoresce under a UV light.
The non-transgenic mouse does not have the gene that causes fluorescence. (credit: Ingrid Moen et al.)
Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats. In one commercial example, the
FDA has approved a blood anticoagulant protein that is produced in the milk of transgenic goats for use in humans.
Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.
Transgenic Plants
Manipulating the DNA of plants (creating genetically modified organisms, or GMOs) has helped to create desirable
traits such as disease resistance, herbicide, and pest resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf life (Figure
10.10). Plants are the most important source of food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select
for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-day biotechnology practices were established.

biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)
Transgenic plants have received DNA from other species. Because they contain unique combinations of genes and
are not restricted to the laboratory, transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government
agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life.

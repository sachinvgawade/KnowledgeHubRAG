FIGURE 10.4 Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to produce many copies of a specific sequence of DNA using a special form of DNA
polymerase.
Cloning
In general, cloning means the creation of a perfect replica. Typically, the word is used to describe the creation of a
genetically identical copy. In biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.”
Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to copy short stretches of
DNA—a process that is referred to as molecular cloning. The technique offered methods to create new medicines
and to overcome difficulties with existing ones. When Lydia Villa-Komaroff, working in the Gilbert Lab at Harvard,
published the first paper outlining the technique for producing synthetic insulin, diabetes researchers and patients
received new hope in fighting the disease. Insulin at that time was only produced using pig and cow pancreases, and
the life-saving substance was often in short supply. Synthetic insulin, once mass produced, would solve that
problem for many patients. These early discoveries led to the "BioTech Boom," and spurred continued research and
funding for newer and better ways to improve health.
Molecular Cloning
Cloning allows for the creation of multiple copies of genes, expression of genes, and study of specific genes. To get
the DNA fragment into a bacterial cell in a form that will be copied or expressed, the fragment is first inserted into a
plasmid. A plasmid (also called a vector in this context) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates
independently of the chromosomal DNA in bacteria. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a

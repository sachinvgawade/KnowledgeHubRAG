FIGURE 10.6 This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.
Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they contain new
combinations of genetic material. Proteins that are produced from recombinant DNA molecules are called
recombinant proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. Plasmids may also be
engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control
the expression of the recombinant proteins.
Reproductive Cloning
Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism.
Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves the contribution of DNA from
two individuals (parents), making it impossible to generate an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent

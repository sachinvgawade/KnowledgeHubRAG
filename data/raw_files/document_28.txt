Biotechnology
10.1 Cloning and Genetic Engineering
10.2 Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture
10.3 Genomics and Proteomics
The latter half of the twentieth century began with the discovery of the structure
of DNA, then progressed to the development of the basic tools used to study and manipulate DNA.
These advances, as well as advances in our understanding of and ability to manipulate cells, have
led some to refer to the twenty-first century as the biotechnology century. The rate of discovery
and of the development of new applications in medicine, agriculture, and energy is expected to
accelerate, bringing huge benefits to humankind and perhaps also significant risks. Many of these
developments are expected to raise significant ethical and social questions that human societies
have not yet had to consider.
10.1 Cloning and Genetic Engineering
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the basic techniques used to manipulate genetic material
•
Explain molecular and reproductive cloning
Biotechnology is the use of artificial methods to modify the genetic material of living organisms or
cells to produce novel compounds or to perform new functions. Biotechnology has been used for
improving livestock and crops since the beginning of agriculture through selective breeding. Since
the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, and particularly since the development of tools and
methods to manipulate DNA in the 1970s, biotechnology has become synonymous with the
manipulation of organisms’ DNA at the molecular level. The primary applications of this
technology are in medicine (for the production of vaccines and antibiotics) and in agriculture (for

the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The polymerase enzyme most often used with PCR comes from a strain of
bacteria that lives in (b) the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. (credit a: modification of work by Magnus

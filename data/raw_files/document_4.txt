Now let’s consider the structure of the two types of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
(RNA). The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, which are made up of three parts: a deoxyribose (5-carbon
sugar), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (Figure 9.3). There are four types of nitrogenous bases in DNA.
Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are double-ringed purines, and cytosine (C) and thymine (T) are smaller, single-ringed
pyrimidines. The nucleotide is named according to the nitrogenous base it contains.

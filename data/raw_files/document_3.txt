techniques have revolutionized plant and animal breeding for human agricultural needs. All of
these advances in biotechnology depended on basic research leading to the discovery of the
structure of DNA in 1953, and the research since then that has uncovered the details of DNA
replication and the complex process leading to the expression of DNA in the form of proteins in the
cell.
9.1 The Structure of DNA
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe the structure of DNA
•
Describe how eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA is arranged in the cell
In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together at the University of Cambridge,
England, to determine the structure of DNA. Other scientists, such as Linus Pauling and Maurice
Wilkins, were also actively exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of
proteins using X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a method for investigating molecular
structure by observing the patterns formed by X-rays shot through a crystal of the substance. The
patterns give important information about the structure of the molecule of interest. In Wilkins’ lab,
researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray crystallography to understand the structure of DNA.
Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule using Franklin's
data (Figure 9.2). Watson and Crick also had key pieces of information available from other
researchers such as Chargaff’s rules. Chargaff had shown that of the four kinds of monomers
(nucleotides) present in a DNA molecule, two types were always present in equal amounts and the
remaining two types were also always present in equal amounts. This meant they were always
paired in some way. In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the
Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work in determining the structure of DNA.

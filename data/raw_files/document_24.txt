Key Terms
alternative RNA splicing
a post-transcriptional gene
regulation mechanism in eukaryotes in which
multiple protein products are produced by a single
gene through alternative splicing combinations of
the RNA transcript
codon
three consecutive nucleotides in mRNA that
specify the addition of a specific amino acid or the
release of a polypeptide chain during translation
deoxyribose
a five-carbon sugar molecule with a
hydrogen atom rather than a hydroxyl group in the
2' position; the sugar component of DNA
nucleotides
DNA ligase
the enzyme that catalyzes the joining of
DNA fragments together
DNA polymerase
an enzyme that synthesizes a new
strand of DNA complementary to a template strand
double helix
the molecular shape of DNA in which
two strands of nucleotides wind around each other
in a spiral shape
epigenetic
describing non-genetic regulatory factors,
such as changes in modifications to histone proteins
and DNA that control accessibility to genes in
chromosomes
exon
a sequence present in protein-coding mRNA
after completion of pre-mRNA splicing
gene expression
processes that control whether a
gene is expressed
genetic code
the amino acids that correspond to
three-nucleotide codons of mRNA
helicase
an enzyme that helps to open up the DNA
helix during DNA replication by breaking the
hydrogen bonds
intron
non–protein-coding intervening sequences
that are spliced from mRNA during processing
lagging strand
during replication of the 3' to 5'
strand, the strand that is replicated in short
fragments and away from the replication fork
leading strand
the strand that is synthesized
continuously in the 5' to 3' direction that is
synthesized in the direction of the replication fork
mismatch repair
a form of DNA repair in which non-
complementary nucleotides are recognized,
excised, and replaced with correct nucleotides
mRNA
messenger RNA; a form of RNA that carries
the nucleotide sequence code for a protein
sequence that is translated into a polypeptide
sequence
mutation
a permanent variation in the nucleotide
sequence of a genome
nitrogenous base
a nitrogen-containing molecule
that acts as a base; often referring to one of the
purine or pyrimidine components of nucleic acids
nontemplate strand
the strand of DNA that is not
used to transcribe mRNA; this strand is identical to
the mRNA except that T nucleotides in the DNA are
replaced by U nucleotides in the mRNA
nucleotide excision repair
a form of DNA repair in
which the DNA molecule is unwound and separated
in the region of the nucleotide damage, the
damaged nucleotides are removed and replaced
with new nucleotides using the complementary
strand, and the DNA strand is resealed and allowed
to rejoin its complement
Okazaki fragments
the DNA fragments that are
synthesized in short stretches on the lagging strand
phosphate group
a molecular group consisting of a
central phosphorus atom bound to four oxygen
atoms
post-transcriptional
control of gene expression after
the RNA molecule has been created but before it is
translated into protein
post-translational
control of gene expression after a
protein has been created
primer
a short stretch of RNA nucleotides that is
required to initiate replication and allow DNA
polymerase to bind and begin replication
promoter
a sequence on DNA to which RNA
polymerase and associated factors bind and initiate
transcription
replication fork
the Y-shaped structure formed
during the initiation of replication
RNA polymerase
an enzyme that synthesizes an RNA
strand from a DNA template strand
rRNA
ribosomal RNA; molecules of RNA that combine
to form part of the ribosome
semiconservative replication
the method used to
replicate DNA in which the double-stranded
molecule is separated and each strand acts as a
template for a new strand to be synthesized, so the
resulting DNA molecules are composed of one new
strand of nucleotides and one old strand of
nucleotides
splicing
the process of removing introns and
reconnecting exons in a pre-mRNA
start codon
the AUG (or, rarely GUG) on an mRNA
from which translation begins; always specifies
methionine
stop codon
one of the three mRNA codons that
specifies termination of translation
telomerase
an enzyme that contains a catalytic part
and an inbuilt RNA template; it functions to maintain
telomeres at chromosome ends
telomere
the DNA at the end of linear chromosomes
template strand
the strand of DNA that specifies the

structure; the nucleosomes are the “beads” and the short lengths of DNA between them are the “string.” The
nucleosomes, with their DNA coiled around them, stack compactly onto each other to form a 30-nm–wide fiber. This
fiber is further coiled into a thicker and more compact structure. At the metaphase stage of mitosis, when the
chromosomes are lined up in the center of the cell, the chromosomes are at their most compacted. They are
approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.
In interphase, the phase of the cell cycle between mitoses at which the chromosomes are decondensed, eukaryotic
chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. There is a tightly packaged region that
stains darkly, and a less dense region. The darkly staining regions usually contain genes that are not active, and are
found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The lightly staining regions usually contain genes that are
active, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.

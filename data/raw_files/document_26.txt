transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by
the process of translation. The genetic code is the
correspondence between the three-nucleotide mRNA
codon and an amino acid. The genetic code is
“translated” by the tRNA molecules, which associate a
specific codon with a specific amino acid. The genetic
code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA
specify only 20 amino acids and three stop codons.
This means that more than one codon corresponds to
an amino acid. Almost every species on the planet uses
the same genetic code.
The players in translation include the mRNA template,
ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The
small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA template.
Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA.
The formation of bonds occurs between sequential
amino acids specified by the mRNA template according
to the genetic code. The ribosome accepts charged
tRNAs, and as it steps along the mRNA, it catalyzes
bonding between the new amino acid and the end of
the growing polypeptide. The entire mRNA is translated
in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a
stop codon is encountered, a release factor binds and
dissociates the components and frees the new protein.
9.5 How Genes Are Regulated
While all somatic cells within an organism contain the
same DNA, not all cells within that organism express
the same proteins. Prokaryotic organisms express the
entire DNA they encode in every cell, but not
necessarily all at the same time. Proteins are
expressed only when they are needed. Eukaryotic
organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded
in any given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount
of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression.
To express a protein, the DNA is first transcribed into
RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In
prokaryotic cells, these processes occur almost
simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription
occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the
translation that occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene
expression in prokaryotes is regulated only at the
transcriptional level, whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene
expression is regulated at the epigenetic,
transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and
post-translational levels.

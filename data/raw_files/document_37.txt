Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones
Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the
immune system. Modern techniques use specific genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors and mass-produced
in bacteria to make large quantities of specific substances to stimulate the immune system. The substance is then
used as a vaccine. In some cases, such as the H1N1 flu vaccine, genes cloned from the virus have been used to
combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.
Antibiotics kill bacteria and are naturally produced by microorganisms such as fungi; penicillin is perhaps the most
well-known example. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells. The
fungal cells have typically been genetically modified to improve the yields of the antibiotic compound.
Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of the human hormone insulin in E. coli as
early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in
many humans because of differences in the insulin molecule. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to
treat growth disorders in children. The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA (complementary DNA) library and
inserted into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.
Transgenic Animals
Although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins need
a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. For this reason, genes have been cloned and expressed in animals
such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called
transgenic animals (Figure 10.9).

FIGURE 9.13 Proofreading by DNA polymerase (a) corrects errors during replication. In mismatch repair (b), the incorrectly added base is
detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease
action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base. Nucleotide excision (c) repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines
lying adjacent to each other can form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.
Most mistakes are corrected; if they are not, they may result in a mutation—defined as a permanent change in the
DNA sequence. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences like cancer.

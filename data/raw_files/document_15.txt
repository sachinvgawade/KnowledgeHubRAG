FIGURE 9.15 The initiation of transcription begins when DNA is unwound, forming a transcription bubble. Enzymes and other proteins
involved in transcription bind at the promoter.
Elongation
Transcription always proceeds from one of the two DNA strands, which is called the template strand. The mRNA
product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the
nontemplate strand, with the exception that RNA contains a uracil (U) in place of the thymine (T) found in DNA.
During elongation, an enzyme called RNA polymerase proceeds along the DNA template adding nucleotides by
base pairing with the DNA template in a manner similar to DNA replication, with the difference that an RNA strand is
being synthesized that does not remain bound to the DNA template. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is
continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (Figure 9.16).
FIGURE 9.16 During elongation, RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds
then rewinds the DNA as it is read.
Termination
Once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template
and liberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination
signals, but both involve repeated nucleotide sequences in the DNA template that result in RNA polymerase stalling,
leaving the DNA template, and freeing the mRNA transcript.
On termination, the process of transcription is complete. In a prokaryotic cell, by the time termination occurs, the
transcript would already have been used to partially synthesize numerous copies of the encoded protein because
these processes can occur concurrently using multiple ribosomes (polyribosomes) (Figure 9.17). In contrast, the
presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.
